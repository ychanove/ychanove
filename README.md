- ‚ú® Hi there! Welcome to user:ychanove's github.

- üå± **Does it seem empty?** As a new programmer, most of their
repositories are part of assesment in university, therefore
cannot be shared publicly! Sorry!
 
 - üêÅ Languages used to develop projects: Java,
                                          Python,
                                          HTML,
                                          SQL,
                                          C

## Here's a list of projects they've worked on:

### Java:

**Riversi game**    
-  Given a "broken" reversi game to locate errors in and fix
          
**Estate agency app**          
- Developped an app for managing an estate agency for CLI.
          
**Quiz management system**          
- Worked on a group project to implement a database (using Hibernate) to
          manage a series of quizzes, their questions, save the answers
          and scored of the users and create unique quizzes based on
          the questions the user got wrong. No GUI, just CLI.
          


### Python

**Phonebook app**
- Developed a simple phonebook app to store, access and remove contacts.
        No better way to learn the basics!
        
**Sorting algorithm**
- Worked on a page rank algorithm (inspired by the one Google uses). For this
        project I was provided with a skeleton to work off of!
        

## C

**Job queue**
- This was a tough one! Provided with a skeleton for the project, learned how to
      work with structs to create "objects". How to open, read and write in files, how to
      implement a process queue and make use of concurency.
      
## SQL

**Database for a bus company**
- Simple database management, I find working on RDBMS very fun! This database was
      not too complicated, but highlighted how much work goes into database management and
      why.
      

- **Missing something?** This user is still working on their HTML projects. They will be added
in once completed.
